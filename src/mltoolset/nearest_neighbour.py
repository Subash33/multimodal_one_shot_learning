    Implementation of the exact mode efficient nearest neighbor computation
    described by [1]_.

    For each query q (in `q_batch`), the nearest neighbour in memory M is
    computed as (where K[i] are the keys in memory `m_keys`):

        NN(q,M) = argmax_i qÂ·K[i]

    Since the query and memory keys are *normalized (|q|=1; |K[i]|=1), this
    corresponds to nearest neighbour with cosine similarity.

    The nearest neighbours for the batch of queries Q (`q_batch`) is computed
    with a single matrix multiplication: Q x M^T

    (*normalized: beforehand or by this function if `normalize=True`)
